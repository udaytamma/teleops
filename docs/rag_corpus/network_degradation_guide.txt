Network degradation incidents often present as elevated latency, increased packet loss, and jitter.
Common causes include link congestion, interface errors, or routing instability. Evidence typically
includes bursty loss metrics on core routers, correlated alarms across edge devices, and sustained
latency spikes. Mitigation steps include rerouting traffic, applying QoS controls, and inspecting
interface counters for errors or drops.
