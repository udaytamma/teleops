1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
TeleOps turns noisy alerts into incidents and RCA using baseline + LLM.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Generate a controlled DNS outage with deterministic noise.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alerts correlate into a single incident with context.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Baseline RCA gives deterministic hypotheses; LLM adds evidence-grounded reasoning.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alert samples verify signal quality and correlation.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Observability surfaces KPIs, test coverage, and evaluation scores.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Structured RCA outputs are stored; full prompt/response text is not.

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Next: expand RAG corpus, improve LLM accuracy, integrate real alerts.
