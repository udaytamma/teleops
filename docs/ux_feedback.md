# UX Feedback (Sample)

Feedback gathered from peers reviewing the demo UI.

1) "I want to see the most relevant alerts for the incident without leaving the page."
2) "Filtering incidents by severity would help me triage faster."
3) "A quick snapshot of incident metadata would make the RCA feel more grounded."

Planned responses:
- Add an alert sample panel for the selected incident.
- Add severity/status filters to the incident queue.
- Add a compact incident context card with counts and ownership.
