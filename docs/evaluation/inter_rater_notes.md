# Inter-Rater Notes (Sample)

These notes capture calibration guidance for two reviewers using the rubric.

- Use the same device naming as the label (e.g., `core-router-1`) to award full credit.
- If a hypothesis cites congestion but not the device, score 0.7 unless evidence implies a specific component.
- When outputs list multiple hypotheses, score only the highest-confidence one.
- Disagreements larger than 0.3 should be discussed and resolved with a short rationale.
